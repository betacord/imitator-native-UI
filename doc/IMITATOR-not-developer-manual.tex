\chapter{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\imitator{}~\cite{Andre21} has no developer manual, for many (mainly bad) reasons:
lack of time, small team of developers with strong interactions, little concurrent development.

Nevertheless, this document tries (or will try) to summarize some of the important internal characteristics of \imitator{}.
It will naturally evolve over time.

\chapter{Development environment}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The OCaml version used to develop \imitator{} is OCaml 4.08.0.

\chapter{Parsing process}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Since version 3.0, the parsing process is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Get the options from the terminal command
	\item Parse the model
	\item Depending on the option (notably, the presence or not of a \styleOption{-mode}, that triggers translation or syntax check instead of looking for a property), decide whether a property should be parsed or not; if so, parse the property
	\item Check and convert to abstract structures at the same time both the model and the property (if any)
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Constraint representation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Constraints are implemented using the Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL)~\cite{BHZ08}.
Constraints in PPL use integer-valued indexes for variables.

In \imitator{}, the variables are numbered as follows in the constraint, starting from~0:
\begin{itemize}
	\item first the parameters
	\item then the regular clocks in the model
	\item then the observer clock (if any), automatically inferred from the property (if any)
	\item then the extra reset clock (mainly used to measure time elapsing in non-Zeno checking)
	\item then all discrete variables.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Type inference}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Since version 3.1 and the addition of \styleIMI{int} and \styleIMI{bool} types, a type inference system is added to \imitator{}.
Details can be obtained on how the types are inferred using the following command:

%------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{terminal}
imitator model.imi -verbose high | grep "Infer"
\end{terminal}
%------------------------------------------------------------

\chapter{Algorithms class diagrams}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We give below the class diagram of the non-distributed algorithms implemented in \imitator{} below.
Virtual classes are depicted in yellow.

The full class diagram of all algorithm classes (included distributed algorithms) is given in the next page.

\chapter{Testing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Non-regression tests can be called using


%------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{terminal}
python tests/test.py
\end{terminal}
%------------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to call only a subset of the tests using the tag system.
An example of command is:

%------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{terminal}
python tests/test.py --filter="tags=mydesiredtag"
\end{terminal}
%------------------------------------------------------------

\noindent{}where ``\texttt{mydesiredtag}'' represents the tag the tests should match to be called.

The non-regression tests are defined in the file \texttt{tests/regression\_tests\_data.py}.
