## ParsingStructureUtilities module

This module contains a lot of generic functions that allow you to traverse and fold the parsing structure tree and applying a given function to the leaves of the tree. Note that a leaf in parsing structure is either a variable, constant or a function call.

Like `List` in OCaml, this module contains `exist`, `for_all`, `iterate` functions on all parsing structure types.

# Updates

## Sequential and continuous updates

Updates triggers from the `AlgoStateBased` module, using the `DiscreteExpressionEvaluator` module.

There is two types of update:

 - Sequential update (Direct update)
 - Delayed update

Updates are makes at `AlgoStateBased.compute_new_location_guards_updates`.

## Assignment mode

### Assignment by copy

In an update, in both sequential or not-sequential, variables are assigned by copy. It means that when we make an assignment of one variable `x` to another `y`, the value of `x` is copied to `y`. The two variables are independent. Therefore, modifying the value of one of these doesn't impact the value of the other.

For example in the update `a := b`, `b` is copied and assigned to `a`. This behavior is valid whatever the type of the variable.
The described copy is a deep copy.

Why ? because as a function can be executed many time in a given transition, using reference instead of a copy of a variable make unpredictable results. Especially when update is make through a user function used in a guard or invariant (as they may be called many time given one transition).

The function that make the copy can be found at `Location.copy_discrete`.

### Assignment by reference

The only case where a variable is assigned by reference, is when we get the return value of some side effect functions like `stack_push`, `stack_clear`, `queue_push` and `queue_clear`. In this case, the reference returned is the reference to the element that is modified by the function.

For example:

```
(* here s1 get the ref of s2 *)
s1 := stack_push(0, s2);
(* We push an element to s2 *)
stack_push(1, s2);
(* After instruction above s1 is a ref to s2 s1 = [0, 1] ans s2 = [0, 1] *)
```

Why ?

The side effect builtin functions in IMITATOR aims to perform quick operations and avoid long copy. Moreover, a side effect function cannot be used in a guard / invariant, therefore it's safe to get a reference in the case of an update, because it will be perform just one time by transition.

The functions that return reference can be found at:

 - `DiscreteExpressionEvaluator.eval_stack_expression_with_context`
 - `DiscreteExpressionEvaluator.eval_queue_expression_with_context`
